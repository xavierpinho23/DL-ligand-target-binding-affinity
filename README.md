Due to the high cost and labor required for drug discovery and robust characterization of interactions between ligands and targets, various Machine Learning (ML) models have been proposed as cost-effective means to advance this process in terms of predicting the interactions for subsequent verification [1]. Most of the model predictions that have been proposed to predict interactions have focused on binary classification [2]. Herein, we tested a computational approach to predict the binding affinity in a continuous display. In this study we deployed various ML techniques to a heterogeneous set of drugs from public databases, after establishing an in silico pipeline for feature extraction of both ligand and target.
